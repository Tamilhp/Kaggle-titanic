# Kaggle-titanic 
This repository contains my approach to the infamous Kaggle-Titanic problem. This is my first machine learning model, so please forgive me if you find any mistakes or redundancies in the approach. Suggestions and feedbacks are welcome.

# Competition:
  As you are all aware of the titanic tragedy, the objective in this problem is to predict the chances of survivability of the passengers.
  The dataset contains training and test data with each 891 and 418 records respectively.
  So, train the model using training dataset and use the model to predict on test dataset.
  
  Note: In this competition, I was able to achieve a score of 0.78468 and the submission file is attached in the repository
  
# Approach to the problem
